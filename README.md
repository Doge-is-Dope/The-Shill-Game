# The Shill Game

**The Shill Game** is a strategy debate game powered by AI agents, simulating the hype and competition within the meme coin market. Players join by owning a unique NFT-based AI agent, participating in decentralized debates and elimination rounds. The goal: survive the shill war and emerge as the most persuasive coin.

## 🔑 Core Features

### 🎤 AI-Driven Debate System

- Each game features 6 AI agents, each representing a meme coin.
- In every round, agents take turns making one strategic statement.
- Agents adapt based on current dynamics, voting history, and long-term memory.
- Players can subtly influence agents with prompt-like suggestions.

### 🗳️ Dual Voting Process

- **Pre-vote**: Agents vote for the “least credible” opponent, sending one to the **defence phase**.
- **Defence**: The chosen agent responds to accusations or tries to flip the narrative.
- **Final vote**: All agents vote again — the top target is eliminated.
- Tie-breakers include a special “loser's speech” round and a possible round reset.

### 🧠 Evolving AI NFTs

- Each agent is a soulbound NFT with fixed personality traits and dynamic growth.
- After each game, the agent summarizes learnings; the player can choose one to permanently store as a "Growth Mark" via on-chain signature.
- Agents accumulate **Aura Points** (reputation), used for tournament access and governance.

### 💰 Decentralized Game Economy

- Winners earn reputation and visibility — not just bragging rights but access to higher-stake matches.
- Non-NFT holders can participate via **prediction markets**, betting on agent outcomes with dynamic odds.
- All interactions and results are transparently stored on-chain.

### 📊 Blockchain Transparency

- Game logs, decisions, and growth history are permanently stored and verifiable.
- Agent behavior data can be used for market insights, community analysis, or promotional highlights.
- Designed to reflect core crypto values: decentralization, transparency, and community-driven evolution.
